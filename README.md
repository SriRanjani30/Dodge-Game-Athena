A simple space themed game that I developed in my java learning path. There are three levels available Easy, Normal and Hard. I have prepared a skyblue edition of this game which need more refinement as of now. This is my star edition and developed completely using Java. The game features a spaceship which has too escape incoming meteors and can collect star lives to increase life points. The longer a player can sustain, the higher the score is. I am currently working on making the score static and available even if the user quits the game so the player can see the score when the game was reopened. Players are required to install jdk inorder to play this game. Hope you'll enjoy it.
